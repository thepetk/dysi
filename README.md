D.Y.S.I (Did you send it?) is an oblivious transfer protocol written in python. The project has been developed in the context of the Privacy Protection course of Rovira i Virgili University.

## Background

Oblivious Transfer (OT) is a cryptographic primitive that enables secure multiparty computation, privacy-preserving protocols, and secure data exchange. A sender is able to transfer one of many pieces of information to a receiver, without knowing which piece was received, while ensuring the receiver learns nothing about the other pieces. This project explores the implementation of an Oblivious Transfer protocol, using a set of cryptographic techniques to ensure integrity, preserve privacy and not to allow minimal information leakage between participants.
